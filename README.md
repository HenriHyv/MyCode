# Wireless gaming controller

## Project
This was my first project in Software engineering. Our job was to create some kind of physical object with arduino microcontroller. \
We made Wireless controller using 2 arduino microcontrollers. One microcontroller to send data and other one to receive it for the computer.\
On receiving end we had python script running that reads incoming Arduino data and does given Keyboard inputs on python.



## My Part
My part in the project was to make joystick and button inputs. My group implemented wireless connection between arduino and computer.
