My first ever school project in Computer Science. I made the python code to receive and read wireless Arduino Uno controller's data.
Wireless controller data is send with Transmitted Arduino uno code (Transmitter_7Byte_final.ino file). It reads joystick and pushbutton inputs and sends either 1, 0 or 2
Data is received with Arduino that is connected in the pc that runs Python. And the Python code reads the infomation all the time from the arduino.
In this case it sends either 1, 0 or 2 depending on what is pressed on controller. For pushbuttons when it's not pressed it sends 0 all the time and when one of them is
pressed it sends 1 and does the python command for that pushbutton to do something like make a keyboard input "k".

Here is youtube link for the demo of the wireless controller in game enviroment.
